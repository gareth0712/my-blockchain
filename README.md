# my-blockchain

Create my own blockchain, cryptocurrency and smart contract

# Upcoming Development Roadmap

v3: Create my own Devchain over the ETH network and allow connection to it via Metamask
v4: Deploy a dApp (contracts and thegraph) with similar functionalities with DEX on devchain for practice
v5: Deploy the frontend interface of the dApp (Maybe in another repo)

# Blockchain

Go to "blockchain" directory. The [README.md](blockchain) there will guide you hosting a Python server containing APIs that allow you to create a blockchain and mine new blocks.

# Smart contracts

Go to "smart-contract" directory. [README.md](smart-contract) there will guide you how to start a React application that allows users to play an on-chain Lottery game (only on Ropsten Test network) with their Ether on Ropsten Test network.
